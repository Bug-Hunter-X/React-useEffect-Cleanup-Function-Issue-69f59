# React useEffect Cleanup Function Issue

This repository demonstrates a potential issue with the cleanup function in React's `useEffect` hook.  The issue may manifest as the cleanup function not being reliably called before the next effect or component unmount, leading to memory leaks or inconsistent behavior. This example shows a simple counter component and the effect of the cleanup. 

## Problem

The `useEffect` hook is used to perform side effects, but it's critical to use a cleanup function if the effect needs to clean up after itself. This can be something like clearing intervals, event listeners, or subscriptions. 

## Solution

Ensure that you correctly use the return statement within your `useEffect` hook to provide a proper cleanup function. It's crucial to identify and address any potential reasons for the cleanup function being unexpectedly skipped or ignored.
